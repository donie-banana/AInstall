# AInstall
Checks multiple installation tools to more easily install whatever you want. 
Only works on PowerShell, i recommend using it with admin privileges.

# Easy install
1. install release
2. run Install.bat
3. done!

# Once installed
Once you have it installed, run 'AInstallPre' to install the prerequisites for the other commands.
When thats done you can now use:
- AInstall <name> to install whatever you want
- AUninstall <name> to uninstall whatever you want
- check <exists/installed> <name> <(optional) manager> to check if somethings exists and if its is installed
